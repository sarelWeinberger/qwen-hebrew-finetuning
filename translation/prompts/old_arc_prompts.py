manual comparison on Gemini 2.5:
Looks like ‘ARC_INSTRUCT_V1_GEMINI’ as a system prompt works best both
on gemini-flash and gemini-pro.

Enabling thinking improves results on the flash model, but only slightly
improves results on the pro model.

2.  **Accuracy:** Preserve the precise scientific meaning of the original text. Do not simplify the core concept, but ensure the language used to explain it is accessible.
3.  **Grammar:** Pay close attention to Hebrew grammar, especially gender and number agreement (e.g., `דלת המקרר מוליכה` vs. `הברזל מוליך`).
4.  **Conciseness:** Be direct and to the point. Avoid overly academic or verbose phrasing.
5.  **Purity:** Translate *only* the text within the `<question>` and `<option>` tags. Do not add any introductory phrases, explanations, or text outside the required format."""

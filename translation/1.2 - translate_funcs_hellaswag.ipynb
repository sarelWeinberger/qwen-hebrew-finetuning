      "Okay, so I'm presented with this \"HellaSwag\" example: rafting. The goal is to figure out its cultural relevance within Israel. Honestly, this one's pretty straightforward.  Let's break it down:\n",
      "\n",
      "First, what *is* rafting? Just as I'd expect my user to know, it's a recreational water activity using inflatable rafts. And yes, in Israel, rafting is *hugely* popular, especially on the Jordan River. It's almost synonymous with summer fun for families, youth groups, and tourists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The context describes dipping under a waterfall – which, of course, Israel has its own share of!  The social aspect, posing with fellow rafters, is entirely relatable. The description is remarkably generic and perfectly captures the essence of rafting as it's experienced here. No foreign elements jump out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, my conclusion? This is a \"Universal\" concept. It's instantly recognizable and completely understandable to an Israeli audience.  Rafting is a common, well-loved activity that's part of the cultural fabric here. Done!\n",

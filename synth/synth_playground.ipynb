      "\n",
      "First, probability problems often involve combinations. The general formula for probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are the ways to pick exactly a1 of color 1, a2 of color 2, and so on up to aC of color C. The total possible outcomes would be all the ways to pick A balls regardless of color distribution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me break it down. The total number of ways to choose A balls from N is the combination of N choose A, which is C(N, A) = N! / (A! (N - A)!).\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, the favorable outcomes. For each color i, we need to choose ai balls from the ni available. Since the choices are independent across colors, the number of ways to do this for all colors would be the product of combinations for each color. So that's C(n1, a1) * C(n2, a2) * ... * C(nC, aC). But wait, is that right? Because when you pick a1 from n1, a2 from n2, etc., and the total number picked is A, which should sum up, right? As long as a1 + a2 + ... + aC = A, then this product gives the number of ways to pick exactly that many of each color.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the probability should be [C(n1, a1) * C(n2, a2) * ... * C(nC, aC)] divided by C(N, A). That makes sense because each combination of selecting the specific numbers from each color is a favorable case, and the total cases are all possible A-sized groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me check if there are any conditions. Each ai has to be ≤ ni, obviously, because you can't pick more balls of a color than are present. Also, the sum of ai's must equal A, which is given in the problem. If any ai > ni, the combination C(ni, ai) would be zero, so the probability would be zero, which is correct.\n",

      "Alternatively, this is a multivariate hypergeometric distribution problem. The hypergeometric distribution models the probability of k successes in a certain number of draws without replacement from a finite population.

The formula for the multivariate hypergeometric probability is indeed the product of combinations for each category divided by the combination of the total.\n",

I think when we say a line is equidistant from two points, it's the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting those two points. Right? Because the perpendicular bisector is the set of all points equidistant from the two endpoints. So, if a line is equidistant from two points, it's that bisector. So, maybe for each pair of points, there's a unique line that's equidistant from them. So, for n points, the number of such lines would be the number of pairs of points, which is C(n, 2) or n(n-1)/2. But wait, is that the case?\n",

      "Wait, but the question is not about lines equidistant from pairs of points, but lines equidistant from all n points. Hmm, that's different. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. The problem says \"lines that are equidistant from n given points\". So, does that mean a line such that all n points are equidistant from the line? Or maybe equidistant in the sense that each point has the same distance to the line? That might not even be possible unless all points lie on one side of the line and are arranged in a specific way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe equidistant here means that the line is equidistant from each pair of points, but I'm not sure. Wait, the wording is a bit ambiguous. Let me think. If the line has to be equidistant from all n points, then each of the n points must be at the same distance from the line. But in that case, the points must lie on two lines parallel to the given line, each at the same distance. Because the set of points at a fixed distance from a line lie on two lines (one on each side). So, unless all n points lie on two such lines, there can't be such a line. So, the number of lines would depend on how the points are arranged. But the problem says \"n given points\" in general. So maybe it's a general position problem?\n",

Hmm, the problem states \"n given points\", so maybe the answer depends on the configuration of the points. But if the points are in general position (no three collinear, etc.), how many such lines can exist?\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the problem is referring to lines that are equidistant from each pair of points. But that seems different. Wait, maybe each line must be equidistant to every pair of points? But that seems too strict. For example, the perpendicular bisector of two points is equidistant to those two points, but not necessarily to any other points. So, if we have n points, how many lines can we have that are equidistant from at least two points but not necessarily all. But the question says \"equidistant from n given points\", which would mean all n points. That's confusing.\n",

Therefore, if the n points are in such a configuration, the number of such lines would depend on how the points are arranged. However, if the points are in general position, meaning no three colinear and not lying on two parallel lines, then there might not be any such line. \n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem doesn't specify any particular arrangement of the points, so it's a general question. So, perhaps the answer is that there can be infinitely many lines, or maybe up to three lines? Wait, no. Wait, let's think again. If the points are arranged such that they are symmetric with respect to multiple lines, then each axis of symmetry would be a line equidistant from all points. For example, if the points form a regular polygon, then there are several axes of symmetry, each of which might be equidistant to all points. But in that case, each axis of symmetry would pass through some points, so maybe the distance from the line to each point is zero for some points? Wait, no. If a line passes through a point, the distance from the point to the line is zero, so unless all points are on the line, then you can't have a line equidistant to all points unless all points are on the line. If all points are on a line, then that line itself would have all points at distance zero, which is equidistant, but any line parallel to it would have the points at varying distances. Wait, so in that case, there's only one line (the line itself) where all points are equidistant (distance zero). But if the points are colinear, then any line perpendicular to that line would have points at different distances. Hmm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if all points lie on two parallel lines, then the line midway between them would be equidistant from all points. So, for example, if n points are equally divided on two parallel lines, then the midline is equidistant from all points. But if the points are not equally divided, then the midline might still work. For instance, suppose you have three points on one line and one on the other. The midline would still be equidistant to all four points. So, in this case, there would be one such line.\n",

      "But if the points are not arranged in two parallel lines, then maybe there's no such line. So, the answer could vary depending on the configuration. However, the problem states \"n given points\", without specifying their arrangement, so perhaps we need to consider the maximum possible number of such lines, given n points arranged in a way that allows for the maximum number. Or maybe the problem is expecting a general formula in terms of n, assuming certain configurations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps the problem is misinterpreted by me. Let me check again. The problem is: \"How many lines can be drawn that are equidistant from n given points in the plane?\" So, maybe it's not that the line is equidistant from all n points, but that each line is equidistant from the set of n points. But how do you define a line being equidistant from multiple points? The standard definition is that a line is equidistant from two points if it's the perpendicular bisector. For more than two points, it's not a standard term. So, maybe the problem is referring to lines that are equidistant from each pair of points. But that would be the intersection of all the perpendicular bisectors, but that would only be possible if all the perpendicular bisectors coincide, which would require all points to be co-circular or something.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the problem is asking for the number of lines such that each line is equidistant from at least two of the points, and not necessarily all. But then, for each pair of points, there's one line (the perpendicular bisector), so the total number would be C(n,2) = n(n-1)/2. But the question says \"equidistant from n given points\", which is plural. So, perhaps equidistant from each of the n points. \n",
      "\n",
      "But then, as I thought earlier, such a line must have all n points at the same distance from it. Which would mean that all points lie on two lines parallel to the given line. So, if the n points are arranged such that they lie on two parallel lines, then the midline between them would be equidistant to all points. Additionally, if there are other lines for which all points lie on two lines parallel to those, then more such lines exist. But unless the points are arranged in a grid or something, which is unlikely. So, perhaps for a general case, the maximum number of such lines is 1, if the points are arranged on two parallel lines. But the problem doesn't specify that the points are arranged in any particular way, so the answer might be that there can be 0, 1, or more lines depending on the configuration. But since the problem asks \"How many lines can be drawn...\", maybe it's expecting the maximum possible number given n points, regardless of their arrangement. \n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, maybe there's another interpretation. If we consider that a line is equidistant from three non-collinear points, it has to be the circumcircle's center or something, but no, that's a point. Wait, the set of points equidistant from three non-collinear points is the circumcenter, which is a point, not a line. So, maybe lines equidistant from three or more points don't exist unless the points are arranged in a specific way.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, perhaps equidistant here means that the line is at equal distance from each point, but not necessarily that each point is the same distance. Wait, that doesn't make sense. The distance from a point to a line is a non-negative number, so if the line is equidistant from all n points, then each point has the same distance to the line. Which would require all points to lie on two lines parallel to the given line, each at the same distance. So, for example, if you have points on two horizontal lines, then the horizontal line midway between them is equidistant to all points. Alternatively, if the points are arranged on more than two lines, maybe you can have multiple such midlines. For instance, if points are on two pairs of parallel lines, then there might be two different midlines. But this is getting complicated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, perhaps I need to approach this step by step. Let's start with small n.\n",
      "\n",
      "Case n=1: There's one point. How many lines are equidistant from one point? Well, any line that's at a fixed distance from the point. But since the distance can be any non-negative number, there are infinitely many lines (all lines at distance d from the point, for any d ≥ 0). But the problem says \"n given points\". So, with one point, infinitely many lines. But the problem is asking for n given points, so maybe for n ≥ 2.\n",
      "\n",
      "But let's check n=2. Two points. Then, the set of lines equidistant from both points is the perpendicular bisector of the segment connecting them. So, that's one line. So, the answer for n=2 is 1. So, the number is 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, but perhaps there's another line? If the two points are the same, then any line is equidistant, but since they are distinct points, only the perpendicular bisector. So, yes, one line. So, for n=2, it's 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "For n=3. Let's suppose three non-collinear points. Is there a line equidistant from all three? If they form a triangle, then the three perpendicular bisectors meet at the circumcenter. But the circumcenter is a point, not a line. So, the lines equidistant from all three points would have to have all three points at the same distance from the line. For that to happen, all three points must lie on two parallel lines. For example, two points on one line and the third on the parallel line. Then, the midline between them would be equidistant to all three. But if the three points form a non-degenerate triangle, then they can't all lie on two parallel lines. Therefore, in that case, there's no such line. So, if three points are arranged such that two are on one line and the third is on a parallel line, then there is one such line. Otherwise, if they form a triangle, there are zero. So, depending on the configuration, it's 0 or 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the problem states \"n given points\". So, unless the points are in a specific arrangement, the number varies. However, the problem is phrased as a general question, not specifying the configuration. Maybe we need to find the maximum possible number of lines over all possible configurations of n points. For example, if the points are arranged in a way that allows multiple such lines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let's think. Suppose all n points are on a straight line. Then, the line itself has all points at distance zero. Any line perpendicular to this line will have the points at varying distances. So, only one line (the line containing the points) is equidistant (distance zero) to all points. But if the line is rotated or something, no. Wait, but any line that's not the original line would have points at different distances. So, only one line.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if the points are arranged in two parallel lines. Suppose we have m points on one line and k points on another parallel line, with m + k = n. Then, the midline between them is equidistant to all points. Also, if we have another pair of parallel lines in a different orientation that contain all points, then there could be another midline. For example, if the points form a grid. Suppose n points are arranged as a rectangle (four points). Then, the two midlines (horizontal and vertical) between the sides are equidistant to all four points. Additionally, the two diagonals if it's a square. Wait, but the diagonals of a square are not equidistant to all four points. Let's check. The diagonal of a square: the distance from each vertex to the diagonal is either zero (if the vertex is on the diagonal) or some positive distance. So, no, the diagonals are not equidistant. So, in a square, the midlines (the horizontal and vertical through the center) are equidistant to all four points. So, for a square, two lines. Similarly, if points are arranged in a regular hexagon, maybe more lines. Wait, but in regular polygons with even sides, there are multiple axes of symmetry. For example, a regular hexagon has six axes of symmetry. But each axis of symmetry passes through two opposite vertices and the midpoint of two opposite edges. The lines that are axes of symmetry through the midpoints of edges would be equidistant from the vertices. Let's see: suppose we take a regular hexagon, the line passing through the midpoints of two opposite edges. The distance from each vertex to this line would be the same? Let's calculate. In a regular hexagon with side length s, the distance from a vertex to the midpoint line would vary. Wait, maybe not. Let me think. If the hexagon is centered at the origin and has vertices at (1,0), (0.5, √3/2), (-0.5, √3/2), (-1,0), (-0.5, -√3/2), (0.5, -√3/2). Suppose we take the horizontal line y=0: all vertices are at distance √3/2 or 0. No, the ones on the line y=0 are at distance zero, the others at √3/2. So that's not equidistant. If we take a vertical line x=0, similar issue. If we take a line at 60 degrees, maybe. Wait, maybe this approach isn't working. Perhaps regular polygons are not the way to go.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, if we arrange the points in a rectangle (not a square), then we have two midlines: horizontal and vertical. Each midline is equidistant to all four points. So, two lines. If the rectangle becomes a square, still two lines. So, maybe for four points arranged in a rectangle, two lines. If arranged in a square, same thing. So, in general, arranging points in two sets of parallel lines (horizontal and vertical) might give two lines. So, maybe the maximum number of such lines is the number of pairs of perpendicular directions in which the points can be arranged. But this seems vague.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, think of points arranged in a grid. For example, 3x3 grid points. Then, the horizontal midline, vertical midline, and the two diagonals. Wait, but the diagonals would not be equidistant to all points. For instance, in a 3x3 grid, the main diagonal passes through four points (assuming the grid is 3x3 with points at integer coordinates). The distance from the other points to the diagonal line would vary. So, that line is not equidistant to all points. So, in that case, only horizontal and vertical midlines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, maybe the maximum number of equidistant lines depends on how many pairs of parallel lines the points lie on. Each pair of parallel lines contributes one midline. So, if points lie on k pairs of parallel lines, then you have k midlines. To maximize k, you need to arrange the points such that they lie on as many pairs of parallel lines as possible. For example, if points form a regular polygon, perhaps they lie on multiple pairs of parallel lines, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, if all points lie on a circle, then each diameter is a line equidistant to two points (the ones it's perpendicular bisector of), but not all points.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, maybe the problem has a different approach. For a line to be equidistant from all n points, all points must be at the same distance from the line. The set of points at distance d from a line L forms two lines parallel to L, each at distance d on either side. Therefore, for a line L to be equidistant from n points, all n points must lie on the union of two lines parallel to L. So, the number of such lines L is equal to the number of directions such that the n points lie on two parallel lines in that direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, the problem reduces to finding the number of directions for which the n points lie on two parallel lines. For each such direction, there is exactly one line L (the midline between the two parallel lines) that is equidistant from all n points.\n",

      "Wait, let's take n=4 points arranged in a square. The directions where the points can be split into two parallel lines are horizontal, vertical, and the two diagonals. For horizontal: split into top and bottom rows. Midline horizontal. For vertical: left and right columns. Midline vertical. For the diagonals: split into two lines along the diagonals. Wait, but each diagonal line in a square contains two points. So, if we take a diagonal direction, then the two lines parallel to that diagonal would each contain two points. Then, the midline between them would be equidistant to all four points. But in a square, the diagonals are not parallel; they intersect. Wait, if we take a direction of, say, 45 degrees, then two lines parallel to that direction would have to be spaced apart. But in a square, the points (0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1). A line at 45 degrees would have equations y = x + c. To have two parallel lines each containing two points: maybe y = x and y = x -1? But those lines don't contain the square's points. Alternatively, maybe y = x + 0.5 and y = x - 0.5? Then, the points (0,0) and (1,1) are on y = x, which is not one of those lines. Hmm, perhaps not.

However, the vertices are on the circle, not on the sides. The distance from each vertex to the midline would vary. The vertices on the original sides are at a certain distance, while the other vertices are at a different distance. Therefore, the midline is not equidistant to all points.

Therefore, all points must lie on the two parallel lines, and the original line is equidistant from all points. Therefore, the number of such lines is equal to the number of ways we can have the points lie on two parallel lines. For each such pair of parallels, there's one midline. So, the number of midlines is equal to the number of directions for which the points lie on two parallel lines.\n",

But this is only true if the problem considers lines equidistant from pairs of points. However, the question says \"equidistant from n given points\", implying all n points.

If arranged in multiple pairs of parallels, more. But since the problem says \"given points\", it's likely expecting an answer based on their arrangement, but since the arrangement isn't specified, perhaps the answer is that it's variable. However, math problems usually expect a numerical answer.\n",

      "Wait, another approach: the set of all lines equidistant from n points is the intersection of the sets of lines equidistant from each pair of points. For three non-collinear points, the intersection of their perpendicular bisectors is the circumcenter, which is a single point. For more points, the intersection might be empty. Thus, for n ≥ 3 in general position, no lines are equidistant from all points. For n=2, one line. For n=1, infinitely many. But the problem states n given points. So, if n=1, infinite; n=2, one; n≥3, zero. But the problem says \"n given points\", so if n≥3, answer is zero. But in the problem statement, n is not specified; it's a general question for any n. Hence, the answer depends on n. For n=1, infinite; n=2, 1; n≥3, 0. But the problem says \"n given points\", so likely wants a general formula. If n=1, answer is infinite; else, if n=2, 1; else 0.

      "Alternatively, the problem might have a different interpretation. Maybe \"equidistant from n points\" means that the line is equidistant to each pair of points, i.e., for every pair of points, the line is equidistant to them. In that case, the line must be the perpendicular bisector of every pair of points. Which is only possible if all points are concyclic, and the line is the perpendicular bisector of each pair, which implies all points are on a circle and the line passes through the center. However, such a line would be a diameter, but not all pairs would have their perpendicular bisector as that line unless all points are arranged symmetrically with respect to the line. For example, points are arranged symmetrically pairs about the line. In that case, the line is the perpendicular bisector for each such pair. But for n points, if they are arranged as reflectionally symmetric across the line, then the line is equidistant to each pair of symmetric points. For example, if n is even, pairs of points; if n is odd, one point on the line and pairs of others. Therefore, in such a case, the line is equidistant to all pairs. But the problem says \"equidistant from n given points\", not from each pair. So, if a line is equidistant to all n points, then all points must be equidistant to it. Which requires them to lie on two parallels. However, if they are arranged symmetrically about the line, then the distances vary. Wait, no. If a line is an axis of symmetry, then for each point, its mirror image is on the other side. Therefore, each point's distance to the line is the same as its mirror image. But if the points are symmetrically distributed, then the distances can vary, but if all points are at the same distance, that requires them to lie on two parallels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Therefore, returning to the original conclusion: the line must have all points at the same distance, which requires them to lie on two parallels. The number of such lines is the number of directions in which the points can be split into two parallels. Therefore, the answer is the number of such directions, which varies from 0 to floor(n/2). But since the problem is general, the answer is likely 1 if the points are in two parallels, 0 otherwise.\n",

      "   - For a line to be equidistant from all \\( n \\) points, all points must lie on two parallel lines, and the line must be the midline between these two parallel lines.\n",
      "   - In general, for points in general position (no specific arrangement given), this condition is rarely met, and such a line typically does not exist.\n",

      "1. **Last Digit Must Be Zero:**\n",
      "   - If we remove the last digit (1000th digit) from \\( A \\), the resulting number \\( B \\) must divide \\( A \\). Since \\( B \\) is formed by removing the last digit, the last digit of \\( A \\) must be zero. This ensures that \\( A \\) is 10 times \\( B \\), and thus \\( B \\) divides \\( A \\).\n",

      "   - Extending this reasoning, if we remove any digit from positions 2 to 999, the resulting number \\( B \\) must still divide \\( A \\). For \\( B \\) to divide \\( A \\) after removing any digit from positions 2 to 999, those digits must also be zero. This is because removing a zero digit from \\( A \\) results in a number \\( B \\) that is 10 times smaller, ensuring divisibility.\n",

      "\n",
      "First, I remember that when dealing with integrals involving absolute values, it's important to determine where the expression inside the absolute value is positive and where it's negative over the interval of integration. Then, I can split the integral into parts where the expression is positive and parts where it's negative, taking the absolute value into account by changing the sign accordingly.\n",

      "\n",
      "Now, the other factor is (2/x³ + 1/x). Let's simplify that. Let's combine the terms: (2 + x²)/x³. So, 2/x³ + 1/x = (2 + x²)/x³. Since x is between π/2 and 3π/2, x is positive, so x³ is positive. The numerator is 2 + x², which is always positive because x² is non-negative. Therefore, (2/x³ + 1/x) is positive throughout the interval [π/2, 3π/2].\n",

Hmm, let's think about how to approach this.\\n\\nFirst, probability problems often involve combinations. The general formula for probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of possible outcomes. So, in this case, the favorable outcomes are the ways to pick exactly a1 of color 1, a2 of color 2, and so on up to aC of color C. The total possible outcomes would be all the ways to pick A balls regardless of color distribution.\\n\\nLet me break it down. The total number of ways to choose A balls from N is the combination of N choose A, which is C(N, A) = N! / (A! (N - A)!).\\n\\nNow, the favorable outcomes. For each color i, we need to choose ai balls from the ni available. Since the choices are independent across colors, the number of ways to do this for all colors would be the product of combinations for each color. So that's C(n1, a1) * C(n2, a2) * ... * C(nC, aC). But wait, is that right? Because when you pick a1 from n1, a2 from n2, etc., and the total number picked is A, which should sum up, right? As long as a1 + a2 + ... + aC = A, then this product gives the number of ways to pick exactly that many of each color.\\n\\nSo, the probability should be [C(n1, a1) * C(n2, a2) * ... * C(nC, aC)] divided by C(N, A). That makes sense because each combination of selecting the specific numbers from each color is a favorable case, and the total cases are all possible A-sized groups.\\n\\nLet me check if there are any conditions. Each ai has to be ≤ ni, obviously, because you can't pick more balls of a color than are present. Also, the sum of ai's must equal A, which is given in the problem. If any ai > ni, the combination C(ni, ai) would be zero, so the probability would be zero, which is correct.\\n\\nAlternatively, this is a multivariate hypergeometric distribution problem. The hypergeometric distribution models the probability of k successes in a certain number of draws without replacement from a finite population. The multivariate version extends this to multiple categories, which is exactly the case here with different colors. The formula for the multivariate hypergeometric probability is indeed the product of combinations for each category divided by the combination of the total.\\n\\nTherefore, the probability is the product of combinations C(n_i, a_i) for each color i, divided by the combination C(N, A).
